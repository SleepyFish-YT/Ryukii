AimAssist for every game (in development)

## About this project
In this project i will work together with my good friend,
joel to lean new stuff about AI and Image recognition.
This project will be coded in python so i learn this easy
language i always avoided. This will take its time because
i have other things to do and also in life, so be patient.
