AimAssist for every game (in development)

## About this project
In this project i will work together with my good friend,
joel to lean new stuff about AI and Image recognition.
This project will be coded in python so i learn this easy
language i always avoided. This will take its time because
i have other things to do and also in life, so be patient.

## Planned Ideas
- Use smoothing
- Auto Smoothness
(if not use smoothing)
- Min Pixel move
- Max Pixel move
- Only while holding Shift
- Only while holding Movement keys
- Usage mode (record, use)
- Fov slider
- Show Fov
- Fov render color picker
- AI Confidence
- AI lines (inside fov from crosshair to object)
- AI lines color picker

## Future Ideas
- Config system
- Color Checks
- Triggerbot
- Triggerbot mode only
- Triggerbot speed
- Self Destruct keybind
- Invisible on Taskbar
- Always on bottom
- More AI settings
